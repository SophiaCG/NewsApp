# NewsApp

Simple news app that displays the top headlines. Articles are displayed through an in-app browser using WebKit.

## Purpose

As someone who's well-versed in SwiftUI, I wanted to develop my skills using UIKit. I also wanted to develop my skills in creating UI programmatically (no storyboards) in order to help me have a better understanding of UIKit and its components. 

## APIs Used

This project can only be run by acquiring an API key through the News API (for free).
